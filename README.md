SLREv1 - Original Version of the Super Light Regular Expression library

SLRE is an ANSI C library that implements a tiny subset of Perl regular expressions. It is primarily targeted for developers who want to parse configuation files, where speed is unimportant. It is in single .c file, easily modifiable for custom needs. For example, if one wants to introduce a new metacharacter, '\i', that means 'IP address', it is easy to do so.
